# PWA: Online/Offline Budget Trackers

Add functionality to Trilogy's existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user can add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a network connection. When entering transactions offline, they still populate the total when a network connection is brought back online.

## Usage

Gives users a fast and easy way to track their money, but still allowes them to access that information anytime. Having offline functionality is paramount to applications success. Application works by going to heroku link on/offline and can be saved to a mobile devices home screen as a bookmark.

## Deployment
